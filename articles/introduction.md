# Strategies for Robust Fraud Detection: From Basic to Advanced Approaches
The complexities inherent in fraud detection - severe class imbalance, uncertain labeling, and evolving fraud patterns - demand sophisticated modeling approaches that go beyond conventional machine learning practices. While traditional classification techniques might suffice for balanced datasets, fraud detection requires carefully crafted solutions to overcome its unique challenges.
The most pressing issue is the severe 


Class unbalance challenges:
* Deal with overfitting -> resampling
* Metrics -> PRauc vs ROCauc 
* Monitoring: which metric to monitor if  u do not know rejections outputs (AB tests etc) + retrain triggers
* EDA: monitor fr cross time and segments
* Feature engineering and the Data Leakage Challenge


* beyond timeseries: how to divide traing, test, validation



### Model Training Strategy
```python
# Proper time-aware cross-validation
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit

tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(
    n_splits=5,
    test_size=timedelta(days=30)
)

# Balanced sampling for imbalanced classes
sampler = BalancedBaggingClassifier(
    base_estimator=LGBMClassifier(),
    sampling_strategy='auto',
    n_estimators=10
)
```


## Monitoring and Maintenance
### Performance Metrics
Traditional metrics (precision, recall, F1)
Business-specific KPIs
Population stability index (PSI)
Feature drift monitoring

## Retraining Triggers
Scheduled retraining (e.g., monthly)
Performance degradation alerts
Significant pattern shifts


## The Data Leakage Challenge

### Label Delay
One of the most insidious challenges in fraud detection is label delay. Unlike many machine learning problems where outcomes are immediately known, fraud labels often arrive days or weeks after the transaction.
>Transaction Timeline:\
> Day 0: Transaction occurs\
> Day 1-30: Label pending\
> Day 31+: Fraud status confirmed

### Solution Approach:
1. Implement a "label maturity period"
2. Create a time gap between training and validation sets
3. Regular model retraining as labels mature

## Implementation Best Practices


### Feature Engineering

```python 
def create_fraud_features(df):
    # Time-based features
    df['hour_of_day'] = df['timestamp'].dt.hour
    df['day_of_week'] = df['timestamp'].dt.dayofweek
    
    # Rolling window aggregations
    df['transaction_velocity_24h'] = calculate_velocity(df, window='24h')
    
    # Behavioral patterns
    df['unusual_amount'] = detect_anomalies(df['amount'])
    
    return df
```
